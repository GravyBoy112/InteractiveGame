# InteractiveGame

This is my Final Project
Just a thing to note, after clicking a button on the main menu you have to use the number keys to choose. After your choice the game is over

You can exit the game window by either using the escape key or clicking the x in the corner of the window

You also have to download the folders and images within them, as this is where the game itself derives the images from, so without them it will not operate properly
